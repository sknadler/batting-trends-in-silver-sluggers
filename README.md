# Analyzing Batting Trends in 2024 MLB Silver Slugger Award Winners

This project is a submission to the Connecticut Sports Analytics Symposium's (CSAS) 2025 data challenge, open to any project that uses 2024 Statcast data to analyze some aspect of MLB at-bats during the 2024 season. I decided to analyze any common trends seen in all 20 of MLB's 2024 Silver Slugger winners.

(I was unable to upload the .csv file with the 2024 MLB batting data because of how large the dataset is, but [here](https://yaleedu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/brian_macdonald_yale_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fbrian%5Fmacdonald%5Fyale%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2Fservice%2FCSAS%2F2025%2D04%2D11%20%2D%20CSAS%20at%20Yale%2Fdata%2Echallenge%2Fdata&ga=1) is a link to the data. I used the file 'statcast_pitch_swing_data_20240402_20241030_with_arm_angle.csv,' which includes batting data for the entire 2024 MLB season and eliminates redundant columns found in the earlier version of the dataset.)
